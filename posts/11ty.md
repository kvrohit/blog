title: Moving my blog to 11ty

Like most people, I started my blog using Jekyll. It served me well for the most part but I wanted more control. I switched over to hexo, it was good, had a lot of themes and migrating from Jekyll was a breeze.

But there was something lacking, the ability to customize every small detail down to writing my own theme. I did not tinker this for a while though until one day came across 11ty in one of Learn with Jason's episodes.
