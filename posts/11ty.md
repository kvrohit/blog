title: Moving my blog to eleventy

Like most people, I started my blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It served me well for the most part but I wanted more control. I switched over to [hexo](https://hexo.io/), it was good, had a lot of themes and migrating from Jekyll was a breeze.

But there was something lacking, the ability to customize the fine details. I love writing HTML and CSS so I wanted to develop my own theme for the blog; the aforementioned platforms made it hard to do so.

I came across Eleventy in one of [Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev)'s episode and it looked promising, this is what got me hooked:

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8mJrhhdHWc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

It is quite easy to pickup and get started, so here it is! the blog in 11ty!

I am still working out how I want to organize the files but I seem to have a good layout that works for now.

### Folder structure

```html
/
|-- _includes      # layouts
|-- _site          # this is where eleventy builds the site
|-- css            # stylesheets, copied as is when published
|-- img            # images, copied as is when published
|-- posts          # blog posts
|-- .eleventy.js   # eleventy configuration
|-- index.html     # start page
```

### Eleventy configuration

```js
const syntaxHighlight = require("@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(syntaxHighlight);
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("css");
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("img");
    return {
        passthroughFileCopy: true
    };
}
```

### Layout

This is how the index page is rendered with a list of links to posts:

```html
{%- raw -%}
<div class="blog-list">
    <ul>
    {%- for post in collections.post reversed -%}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}"><h3>{{ post.data.title }}</h3><span>{{ post.data.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</span></a></li>
    {%- endfor -%}
    </ul>
</div>
{%- endraw -%}
```

The site and the blog pages have their own layouts defined in `_includes`. In fact, the `blog` layout extends the `site` layout with its own content. Everyting is styled using plain old `CSS`.

### Hosting

I decided to try [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as my host, it has been fantastic! Best part is, it has built-in support for eleventy. Deploying is dead simple, point it to your git repo and it automatically deploys the site. Updating is as simple as pushing changes to your repo. I would definitely recommend everyone to give netlify a shot, the starter plan is free!!!

I might buy a domain of my own someday, until then the site lives at [https://kvrohit.netlify.app](https://kvrohit.netlify.app/).
