<p>Well, iAMP's back, I've decided to keep it as the default skin.. atleast for now... (by the way, the player does not have two stop buttons, I was too lazy to draw the pause button, so I just used the stop button as a substitute)</p>
<p>Newly Added features:</p>
<ul>
<li>ID3v2x tag handling (Rohit, et. al.)</li>
<li>MPEG information reading</li>
<li>Real time tag editing!!! can even update the tag while the song is playing!!</li>
</ul>
